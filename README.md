# The Quansistor  
### A Generalized Operator-Based Computational Primitive

## Overview

This document introduces the **Quansistor**, a generalized computational primitive defined
purely in terms of **operator-driven state transitions within a computational field**.

Unlike classical transistors, quantum gates, or neural units, the Quansistor is:
- **substrate-independent**
- **logic-agnostic**
- **operator-first rather than instruction-first**

It is intended as a unifying abstraction capable of expressing classical, quantum,
probabilistic, symbolic, and hybrid computation within a single mathematical framework.

This document is foundational and conceptual. It does **not** propose a concrete machine
or architecture.

## Core Idea

A Quansistor is defined by:
- a state space `S`
- an operator algebra `A`
- a distinguished transition operator `T`
- a computational field `F` governing interaction and composition

Computation is modeled as **state evolution under operator dynamics**, not as
sequences of instructions or gates.

## What This Document Does

- Introduces the Quansistor as a **post-classical computational primitive**
- Formalizes computation as **operator dynamics in a field**
- Shows how classical, quantum, stochastic, and neural models appear as **special cases**
- Establishes an operator-centric language compatible with modern mathematical physics

---

## What This Document Does NOT Do

- It does **not** claim computational universality
- It does **not** define a physical implementation
- It does **not** propose performance advantages
- It does **not** depend on quantum mechanics

This is a **theoretical abstraction layer**, not a hardware proposal.

## Intended Audience

- Theoretical computer science
- Mathematical physics
- Operator theory
- Distributed and unconventional computing research

---

## Status

**Conceptual foundation / formal definition.**  
All results are definitional and non-conjectural.

---

## Relation to Other Documents

- Serves as the conceptual entry point for:
  - Quansistor Field Mathematics (QFM)
  - SMRK Hamiltonian construction
  - Operator-based arithmetic computation

## Citation & Use

This document may be cited as an introduction to the Quansistor concept.
Downstream documents build on it but do not depend on any specific interpretation.
